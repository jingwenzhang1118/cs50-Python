# cs50-Python

CS50P is entirely focused on programming with Python. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. 

Here I include the codes I used to solve the questions of *Problem sets*. The original questions of each topic/week can be found on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/" target="_blank">CS50P's website</a>.

Please follow the course's policy on academic honesty when you work on your own codes.
